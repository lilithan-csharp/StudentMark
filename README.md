# StudentMark
## The Student Mark Application
### Program.cs file
The user is asked to write the name of their subjects and enter the percentages of each subject. Right after entering the last subject and its percentage then the user will receive the average of their percentages. They will then receive a pass or fail based on the results of the average. Lastly, they will receive the best subject and lowest percentage. 
### StudentResult file
In this file - we have six methods. The first method is the `AddMark` method which just simply adds the persons subject and percentage to the list.
- The second method it is the `OverallPercentage` method which calculate the overall percentage of all the subjects entered and return the average percentage.
- The third method is the `PassOrFail` method that checks if the student received 60 percent or more, they have passed and if they got below 60 percent they have failed.
- The fourth method is the `WorstPercentage` method that looks for the lowest percentage of the student and returns it.
- The fifth method is the `BestSubject` method that checks for the highest percentage in the list and return the subject of the method.
- The last method is the `TotalSum` method which just simply adds the total of all the percentages added into the list.
